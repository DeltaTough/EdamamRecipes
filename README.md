A small demo app that is using http://edamam.com/ free API tier for recipes search.
App is based on MVVM architecture with router. Makes use of Swift Concurrency in UIKit with both Autolayout and code contraints for the UI. The list is populated with a collection view. No pagination has been implemnted.
A basic Unit Test coverage along with a couple UI Tests applies to the code.
In addition I am caching images been downloaded in order to avoid redundant network calls.
